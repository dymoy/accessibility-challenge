## Name 

Web Accessibility Refactoring Project

## Description

The goal of this project is to refactor the code of an existing website so that it follows web accessibility standards. 

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

In this project I have done the following: 
1. Refactored the index.html file to include semantic HTML elements 
2. Verified that the HTML elements follow a logical structure 
3. Added the alt attribute to <img> elements so that it has alternate descriptions 
4. Confirmed that the heading attributes fall in sequential order 
5. Updated the <title> element to be descriptive of the webpage 
6. Consolidated CSS rules in the .css file so that declarations are not excessively repeated 
7. Added comments in the .css file to describe which element the respective CSS rules apply to

## Name 

Web Accessibility Refactoring Project

## Description

The goal of this project is to refactor the code of an existing website so that it follows web accessibility standards. 

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.
